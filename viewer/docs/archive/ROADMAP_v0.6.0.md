# Video Annotation Viewer v0.6.0 Roadmap (Archived)

> **Archived 2026-07-08.** v0.6.0 released 2025-12-15 (see `CHANGELOG.md`). JOSS submission
> planning continued in [ROADMAP_v0.6.1.md](./ROADMAP_v0.6.1.md) (also archived — see its own
> archive note for how the JOSS work actually concluded).

**Theme:** JOSS Paper & Public Release  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (December 2025)  
**Target Date:** ~~Q2 2026 (after VideoAnnotator v1.4.0 release)~~ shipped earlier than planned  
**Previous Version:** v0.5.0 (VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Integration - October 2025)

---

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

v0.6.0 is a **tightly scoped release** focused exclusively on JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software) paper submission and public release readiness. This version delivers the minimum viable documentation, demo data, and quality improvements required for academic publication.

**Dependency:** VideoAnnotator server v1.4.0 must be released first (provides stable API and complete feature set for documentation).

### **2. Demo Data Regeneration** 🎬

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL (Required for JOSS examples)

- [ ] **Re-process all demo videos** with VideoAnnotator v1.4.x
  - Use latest stable pipeline configurations
