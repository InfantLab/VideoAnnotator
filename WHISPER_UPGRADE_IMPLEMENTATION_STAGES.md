# Whisper Upgrade Implementation Plan - Staged Approach

## Overview

This document outlines a staged approach to implementing the Whisper Pipeline Upgrade Plan. We'll break down the implementation into manageable phases with clear deliverables for each stage.

## Stage 1: WhisperBasePipeline Base Structure

Create the base structure for the `WhisperBasePipeline` class with minimal functionality:

- Class definition and initialization
- Configuration handling
- Basic model loading stubs
- Placeholder methods for key functionality

This stage establishes the foundation but doesn't require working functionality yet.

## Stage 2: WhisperBasePipeline Core Functionality

Implement the core functionality in the `WhisperBasePipeline`:

- Audio extraction from videos
- Device management
- Whisper model loading (both standard and HF)
- Basic embedding extraction
- Memory management and cleanup

This stage should deliver a functional base pipeline that can load models and process audio.

## Stage 3: SpeechPipeline Refactoring

Refactor the `SpeechPipeline` to inherit from `WhisperBasePipeline`:

- Update imports and inheritance
- Modify initialization to leverage base pipeline
- Replace audio extraction with base implementation
- Keep transcription logic but adapt it to use base pipeline
- Ensure backward compatibility

This stage connects the new base pipeline with the existing speech recognition functionality.

## Stage 4: LAIONVoicePipeline Refactoring

Refactor the `LAIONVoicePipeline` to inherit from `WhisperBasePipeline`:

- Update imports and inheritance
- Modify initialization to leverage base pipeline
- Replace audio extraction and Whisper loading with base implementation
- Keep emotion prediction logic intact
- Ensure backward compatibility

This stage integrates the LAION voice analysis with the new base pipeline.

## Stage 5: Advanced Features and Optimization

Implement advanced features in the `WhisperBasePipeline`:

- Embedding caching
- Optimized segmentation strategies
- Memory optimization for large files
- Performance benchmarking and tuning

This stage enhances the base pipeline with performance optimizations.

## Stage 6: Testing and Validation

Comprehensive testing of the refactored architecture:

- Unit tests for each pipeline
- Integration tests for combined functionality
- Performance comparison with previous implementation
- Memory usage profiling

This stage ensures the new architecture works correctly and improves upon the previous implementation.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

1. `src/pipelines/audio_processing/whisper_base_pipeline.py` (new file)
2. `src/pipelines/audio_processing/speech_pipeline.py` (refactor)
3. `src/pipelines/audio_processing/laion_voice_pipeline.py` (refactor)
4. `src/pipelines/audio_processing/__init__.py` (update imports)

### Dependencies

- All required dependencies are already installed in the project environment.
- The refactoring uses existing libraries without introducing new ones.

## Validation Criteria

- Speech recognition quality matches or improves upon current implementation
- Emotion prediction scores match reference implementation
- Memory usage is optimized for large video files
- Code duplication is significantly reduced
- All tests pass after refactoring

This staged approach will ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture while maintaining backward compatibility and system stability.
