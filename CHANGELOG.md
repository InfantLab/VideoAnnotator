## Migration Guide

### From v0.x to v1.0.0

The v1.0.0 release introduces significant architectural changes. Here's how to migrate:

#### Configuration Changes

**Old (v0.x):**
```python
# Direct pipeline initialization
from src.processors.video_processor import VideoProcessor
processor = VideoProcessor(config_dict)
```

**New (v1.0.0):**
```python
# Modern pipeline architecture
from src.pipelines import SceneDetectionPipeline
pipeline = SceneDetectionPipeline(config)
```

#### API Changes

**Old:**
```python
# Direct method calls
results = processor.process_video(video_path)
```

**New:**
```python
# Standardized pipeline interface
results = pipeline.process(video_path, start_time=0, end_time=None)
```

#### Configuration Format

**Old:**
```python
# Python dictionary configuration
config = {
    'video_settings': {'fps': 30},
    'audio_settings': {'sample_rate': 16000}
}
```

**New:**
```yaml
# YAML configuration
video:
  fps: 30
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000
```

#### CLI Changes

**Old:**
```bash
python process_video.py --video video.mp4 --output output/
```

**New:**
```bash
python main.py --input video.mp4 --output output/ --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Breaking Changes

1. **Pipeline Architecture**: Complete rewrite of processing pipelines
2. **Configuration System**: Moved from Python dictionaries to YAML files
3. **CLI Interface**: New unified command-line interface
4. **Output Formats**: Standardized output schemas
5. **Dependencies**: Updated to modern ML libraries

### Deprecation Notices

- Legacy processor classes will be removed in v2.0.0
- Python dictionary configuration deprecated in favor of YAML
- Old CLI scripts will be removed in v2.0.0

### Upgrade Path

1. **Update Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Convert Configuration**: Use new YAML format
3. **Update Code**: Migrate to new pipeline architecture
4. **Test Integration**: Run comprehensive tests
5. **Update Documentation**: Review API changes

For technical specifications, see the [Pipeline Specs](docs/Pipeline%20Specs.md).
