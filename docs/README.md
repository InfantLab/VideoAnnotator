### Active Development
Documents in `development/` are tagged with version numbers and represent current development work:
- `feature_name_v1.1.2.md` - Current development cycle
- `feature_name_v1.2.0.md` - Next major release

### Testing & QA  
Documents in `testing/` follow the same versioning pattern:
- `test_plan_v1.1.1.md` - Current release testing
- `qa_checklist_v1.1.2.md` - Development cycle QA

### Completion & Archive
When development cycles complete:
1. Current development docs move to `archive/`
2. Next version becomes current 
3. New development docs created for future versions
