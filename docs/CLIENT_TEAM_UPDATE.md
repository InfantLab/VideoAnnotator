# Update for Client Team â€” VideoAnnotator (2025-09-26)

This file summarizes recent changes made to the VideoAnnotator repository, the reasoning, impact on clients, how to validate them locally, and next steps.

## TL;DR

- Health endpoint now reports the package version (single source of truth).
- GET /api/v1/jobs no longer returns 500 when a single job record is corrupted; the server logs problematic job IDs and continues returning the rest.
- Running the CLI with no subcommand now starts the API server bound to 0.0.0.0:18011 by default (`uv run videoannotator`).
- Developer docs and installation notes (macOS guidance, .env loading at startup) were updated.

## What changed and why

1. Version alignment

   - The health endpoint's `api_version` now comes from `src/version.py`. This avoids mismatches between the package version and the API response.
   - Reason: clients were seeing different version values and were confused which version the server reported.

2. Resilient job listing

   - The `/api/v1/jobs` listing operation was made defensive: when loading stored job metadata, a single failing job no longer makes the entire request fail with HTTP 500.
   - Problematic jobs are logged (their job_id is included in warnings/errors) and skipped in the listing response.
   - Reason: prevents a single corrupted job record from breaking monitoring and listing operations.

3. CLI default behavior

   - When the `videoannotator` CLI (Typer app) is invoked without a subcommand, it now starts the server on 0.0.0.0:18011 by default.
   - This aligns local developer workflows with the common expectation that running the CLI launches the service.

4. Small fixes and docs
   - Fixed a broken relative import that prevented test collection in unit test runs.
   - `.env` is loaded at API startup now so environment-sourced tokens (for example HF tokens) are picked up in local dev runs.
   - README and installation docs were updated with macOS tips (ffmpeg/libomp) and a corrected npm dev command.

## Impact on clients / users

- API behavior: Health endpoint is more reliable and reflects the package release version.
- Monitoring & dashboards: Job listing is more robust; you should no longer see a sudden 500 error if a single job record is malformed. Instead, a warning appears in the server logs referencing the affected job ID.
- Local dev & deployments: Running `uv run videoannotator` will now start the server on 0.0.0.0:18011 when no subcommand is provided. Existing explicit subcommands and options are unchanged.

## How to validate locally

1. Start the server (default):

```bash
uv run videoannotator
```

The server binds to 0.0.0.0:18011 by default.

2. Check the health endpoint:

```bash
# Health endpoint is publicly accessible (no auth required)
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18011/health | jq .
```

Confirm `api_version` matches the package version from `src/version.py`.

3. Verify job listing resilience:

- Put a deliberately-broken job metadata file into storage (or simulate a corrupt entry if you have a test fixture) and call the jobs API:

```bash
# Set API key from server startup
export API_KEY="va_api_your_key_here"

# List jobs (requires authentication)
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:18011/api/v1/jobs | jq .
```

The API should return the list of healthy jobs; check server logs (logs/api_server.log or stdout) for a warning referencing the problematic job id.

4. Run quick unit tests (developer facing):

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/unit
```

Note: unit tests are largely green but there are a small number of remaining failing tests that are being addressed (see "Pending items" below).

## Pending items and known issues

- Unit tests: 8 unit tests are currently failing in the development environment. They are small, targeted failures around batch-status semantics, storage status normalization on save/load, and size-analysis defaults. These are next to be fixed.
- Integration tests: some integration tests still attempt to load heavy ML models (transformers/whisper/torch) during test collection and fail in minimal developer environments. Strategy options:
  - Provide mocks in CI or local dev to avoid model downloads during tests.
  - Adjust integration tests to be optional / skip unless model deps are present.
- Optional: add an admin repair endpoint or CLI tool to surface and repair corrupted job records (not implemented yet).

## Rollout & compatibility

- Backwards compatibility: API clients that rely on existing endpoints and payloads should be unaffected, except they will now see `api_version` tied to the real packaged version and may observe fewer 500 responses for job listings.
- Logging: server logs will include warnings/errors for problematic job records. No sensitive data is logged.

## Contact / Next steps

If you'd like, the engineering team can:

- Prioritize the 8 failing unit tests now and produce a follow-up patch and short changelog entry.
- Implement a lightweight admin repair CLI command for scanning and repairing corrupted job metadata.
- Add CI-level test fixtures to avoid heavy model loads during CI runs.

Please reply with which of the three follow-ups you'd like us to prioritize and we'll prepare a PR with a short changelog and tests.
