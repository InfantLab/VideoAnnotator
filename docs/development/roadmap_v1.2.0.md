## üéØ v1.2.0 Primary Goal: API Modernization

**MAIN OBJECTIVE**: Transform VideoAnnotator from a Python library into a production-ready API service while maintaining backward compatibility.

### üèÜ Core API Development (CRITICAL PATH)

#### Phase 1: API Foundation (MUST HAVE)
- [ ] **FastAPI Server Implementation** - HTTP REST service with OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] **Job Management System** - Submit, track, and retrieve video processing jobs
- [ ] **Async Processing Queue** - Celery/Redis-based background job processing
- [ ] **Basic Authentication** - API key generation and validation
- [ ] **Database Backend** - PostgreSQL schema for jobs, users, annotations
- [ ] **File Upload/Storage** - Video upload and result storage management

#### Phase 2: Production API Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **User Management** - Registration, authentication, role-based access
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Quotas** - API usage controls and throttling
- [ ] **Job Status Tracking** - Real-time progress updates and notifications
- [ ] **Multiple Output Formats** - COCO, Label Studio, FiftyOne export support
- [ ] **Error Handling & Recovery** - Robust error responses and job recovery
- [ ] **API Versioning** - v1 namespace with future compatibility

#### Phase 3: API Enhancement (NICE TO HAVE)
- [ ] **Webhook System** - Event notifications for job completion
- [ ] **Batch Job Submission** - Process multiple videos in single request
- [ ] **Custom Pipeline Configuration** - User-defined processing workflows
- [ ] **API Analytics** - Usage metrics and performance monitoring

### üñ•Ô∏è New CLI Interface (SUPPORTING API)

#### Essential CLI Commands
- [ ] **videoannotator server** - Start/stop API server
- [ ] **videoannotator process** - Direct video processing (legacy mode)
- [ ] **videoannotator job** - Submit and manage remote jobs
- [ ] **videoannotator auth** - API key management
- [ ] **videoannotator config** - Configuration validation and management

### üìä Supporting Infrastructure (AS NEEDED FOR API)

#### Database & Storage
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Schema** - Users, jobs, annotations tables
- [ ] **File Storage Strategy** - Local/S3 video and result storage
- [ ] **Database Migrations** - Version-controlled schema evolution
- [ ] **Data Backup/Recovery** - Production data safety

#### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] **Docker Containers** - API server containerization
- [ ] **Health Checks** - System monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Logging System** - Structured logging for debugging
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Environment-based config

### ‚ùå Explicitly NOT in v1.2.0 Scope

**These items are deferred to maintain focus on API development:**

- ‚ùå **New Pipeline Development** - No new computer vision models or pipelines
- ‚ùå **Algorithm Improvements** - No changes to existing YOLO11, OpenFace, etc.
- ‚ùå **Multi-modal Analysis** - Advanced cross-pipeline fusion deferred to v1.3.0  
- ‚ùå **Real-time Streaming** - Live video processing postponed
- ‚ùå **Advanced ML Features** - Active learning, quality assessment deferred
- ‚ùå **Desktop GUI** - Web interface development not included
- ‚ùå **Mobile Support** - API designed for server deployment only
- ‚ùå **Plugin System** - Custom model integration delayed to v1.3.0

**Rationale**: v1.2.0 success depends on delivering a robust, production-ready API. Feature creep risks delaying the core API modernization goal.
