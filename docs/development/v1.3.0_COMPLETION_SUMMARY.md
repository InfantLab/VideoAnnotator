## üìù Deferred to v1.4.0

Low-priority items intentionally deferred:

- **Queue Position Display** (T066) - 2 hours
- **Deterministic Test Fixtures** - 8 hours
- **Documentation Reorganization** (T055-T056) - 6 hours
- **External Review Process** (T079-T081) - Part of JOSS submission

These represent ~16 hours of work (< 7% of total) and are non-blocking for release.
