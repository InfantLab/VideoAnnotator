# üöÄ VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Development Roadmap

## Release Overview

VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 represents the **Advanced Features and Innovation** release, building upon the production-ready API foundation of v1.2.0. This release focuses on **advanced ML capabilities**, **multi-modal analysis**, **enterprise features**, and **extensibility** for research and production environments.

**Target Release**: Q3-Q4 2025  
**Current Status**: Planning Phase  
**Main Goal**: Advanced AI capabilities with enterprise-grade features

## ÔøΩ Foundational Prerequisites (Delivered in v1.2.1)
The following enabling components are introduced in v1.2.1 and treated as mandatory baselines for v1.3.0 scope:

- Minimal Pipeline Registry (YAML-backed SSOT) powering CLI + API + docs
- Basic pipeline metadata schema (name, category, outputs, config_schema, examples, schema_version)
- Drift detection workflow (CI check: registry vs generated markdown)
- Error envelope pattern (standard API error format groundwork)
- Health endpoint enrichment (pipeline count, registry load status, GPU availability)
- Initial config validation (presence + primitive type checks)

These reduce architectural risk and accelerate: plugin sandboxing, adaptive processing, multi-modal correlation, and advanced validation layers.

**Last Updated**: January 2025 | Target Release: Q3-Q4 2025  
**Dependencies**: VideoAnnotator v1.2.0 stable release  
**Status**: Planning phase - detailed specifications in development
\n+---\n+\n+## Technical Debt & Deferred Stabilization Items (Carried from v1.2.1)\n+These engineering tasks were intentionally deferred during the light stabilization pass (logging cleanup, auth tightening) to preserve v1.2.x non-breaking scope. They form the early v1.3.0 backlog before major feature expansion.\n+\n+1. Batch / Job Semantics\n+   - Clarify `success_rate` when total pipelines == 0 (return 0.0 or null consistently; update tests)\n+   - Add `started_at` distinct from `queued_at` timestamps\n+2. Retry & Backoff Policy\n+   - First retry delay mismatch (observed ~2.0s vs expected 1.0s); expose configurable base/factor/jitter\n+3. Pipeline Config Defaults\n+   - Inject size analysis / annotation defaults to avoid KeyErrors when sections omitted\n+   - Centralize default expansion (registry-aware)\n+4. Test Media Fixtures\n+   - Deterministic synthetic video (frames, duration, optional audio) & capture mocking to eliminate flaky minimal-file errors\n+5. Storage Lifecycle\n+   - Consistent cleanup of temp job directories & orphaned artifacts\n+   - Retention policy scaffold (dry-run logging; disabled by default)\n+6. Whisper CUDA Adaptation\n+   - Treat CPU fallback as success in CUDA-absent environments; assert explicit fallback log line\n+7. Error Envelope Evolution\n+   - Expand minimal envelope to enumerated taxonomy (backwards-compatible)\n+8. Registry Incremental Enhancements\n+   - Capability/resource hint fields with safe defaults\n+   - Auto-generated pipeline spec docs with CI diff gate\n+9. Logging & Output Consistency\n+   - Remove residual emojis from packaged markdown destined for console contexts (low priority)\n+10. Auth Hardening Follow-ups\n+   - Unit tests for `validate_optional_api_key` (valid, invalid, anonymous)\n+   - Convergence strategy: legacy API key vs token manager tokens\n+\n+Suggested Labels: `type:batch-semantics`, `type:retry-policy`, `type:storage-lifecycle`, `type:config-defaults`, `type:test-fixture`, `needs:registry-extension`, `scope:v1.3.0`.\n+\n+---\n*** End Patch
