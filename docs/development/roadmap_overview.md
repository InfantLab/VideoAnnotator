## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### v1.2.x → v1.3.0 (Breaking Changes)

**Breaking Changes**:

- Authentication required by default (set `VIDEOANNOTATOR_REQUIRE_AUTH=false` for dev)
- CORS restricted (configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
- Package imports changed (`from videoannotator.*` instead of `from src.*`)

**Migration Steps**:

1. Update environment variables (auth, CORS)
2. Update imports in custom code
3. Update storage configuration (persistent directory)
4. Test job cancellation in workflows

**Grace Period**: v1.3.x supports old imports with deprecation warnings (removed in v1.4.0)

### v1.3.x → v1.4.0 (Minimal Breaking Changes)

**Breaking Changes**:

- Old import paths removed (use `videoannotator.*`)
- Some config parameter names standardized
- Legacy examples removed

**Migration Steps**:

1. Update any remaining old imports
2. Review config files (minimal changes)
3. Update to new example format if using examples

**Grace Period**: Smooth transition, most code works as-is

### v1.4.x → v1.5.0+ (Feature Additions)

**No Breaking Changes**: Feature additions only, all v1.4.x code continues to work
