- ⚠️ Missing: Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- ⚠️ Missing: Usage examples in API endpoint descriptions

**JOSS Grading Scale**:
- **Good**: All functions/methods documented with example inputs/outputs
- **OK**: Core API functionality documented
- **Bad**: API undocumented

**Current Grade**: **OK** (needs improvement to **Good**)

**Gaps**:

1. **API Endpoint Documentation**:
   ```python
   # CURRENT (minimal)
   @app.post("/api/v1/jobs/")
   async def submit_job(video: UploadFile, ...):
       """Submit a video processing job."""

   # NEEDED (comprehensive)
   @app.post("/api/v1/jobs/")
   async def submit_job(video: UploadFile, ...):
       """Submit a video processing job.

       Args:
           video: Video file to process (MP4, AVI, MOV)
           selected_pipelines: Comma-separated list (e.g., "person,face,audio")
           config: Optional YAML configuration

       Returns:
           JobResponse with job_id and status

       Example:
           curl -X POST "http://localhost:18011/api/v1/jobs/" \\
             -F "video=@sample.mp4" \\
             -F "selected_pipelines=person,face"

       Raises:
           400: Invalid video format
