# Specification Quality Checklist: VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Production Reliability & Critical Fixes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 11, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec is appropriately focused on user outcomes and business requirements. Technical details (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy) mentioned only in Dependencies section which is appropriate context. Main content describes behaviors, not implementations.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (within allowed limit) - awaiting user response
- All requirements include specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (5 second cancellation, 200ms latency, 100% persistence, etc.)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes not implementation (e.g., "GPU memory released" not "CUDA context destroyed")
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 scenarios covering storage, cancellation, GPU, validation, CORS)
- Scope clearly separates v1.3.0 critical fixes from deferred v1.4.0+ features

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-053) are clearly stated but acceptance criteria are in User Stories, not explicitly linked to each FR
- 6 user stories prioritized P1-P3 cover all critical flows (persistence, cancellation, validation, security, errors, namespace)
- Success criteria are comprehensive and measurable across all priority areas
- Awaiting clarification responses before marking feature fully ready

## Overall Status

**âœ… READY FOR PLANNING**

All clarifications have been resolved:
- Q1: Storage cleanup disabled by default (Option B)
- Q2: Immediate job termination (Option A)
- Q3: Authentication required by default (Option A)

**Scope Updates (2025-10-11)**:
- Added JOSS publication readiness (FR-054 to FR-058, User Story 7)
- Added documentation spring cleaning (FR-059 to FR-064, User Story 8)
- Added script consolidation & diagnostics (FR-065 to FR-070)
- Total: 70 functional requirements across 12 domains

The spec is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
