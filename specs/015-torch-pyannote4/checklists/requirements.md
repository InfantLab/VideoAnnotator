# Specification Quality Checklist: torch 2.11, pyannote.audio 4 and CUDA 12.6

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature is a dependency upgrade, so the spec names libraries, versions and the telemetry
  endpoint: those are the user-visible subject. How (code changes, CI) is left to the plan.
- No clarifications needed: scope from the dependency audit; the telemetry default was found while
  specifying (pyannote.audio 4.0.7's shipped config) and is handled by FR-004 under principle I.
