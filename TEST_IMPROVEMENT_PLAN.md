## üéØ **Updated Phase 1: Test Suite Optimization (Current Priority)**

### Task 1.1: Fix Remaining Storage Logic Issues ‚úÖ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**
**Current Status**: 21/24 batch validation tests passing (87.5% success rate)

```python
# Remaining 3 failures:
# - test_prepare_retry: Job status assertion (JobStatus.PENDING vs RETRYING)
# - test_load_nonexistent_metadata: Exception handling (FileNotFoundError expected)  
# - test_list_jobs: List comparison logic (job ID vs job object comparison)
```

**Action Items:**
- [x] Major batch processing improvements completed (v1.1.1)
- [ ] Fix job status transitions in retry logic
- [ ] Improve error handling for nonexistent metadata
- [ ] Fix list_jobs comparison logic (3 minor fixes needed)

### Task 1.2: Enhance Pipeline Test Coverage ‚úÖ **SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS**
**Current Status**: Core pipelines showing strong stability improvements

```python
# Current Pipeline Test Status:

# ‚úÖ Face Analysis: 10/15 tests pass (66% success, 5 skipped placeholders)  
# ‚úÖ OpenFace 3.0: GPU acceleration working, export bugs fixed
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio Processing: Integration tests still need work
```

**Action Items:**
