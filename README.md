# Baby Jokes Video Analysis
## Caspar Addyman <infantologist@gmail.com>

A project using machine learning models to analyse dataset of videos of parents demonstrating jokes to babies.



## Dataset
A small test dataset is provided in `LookitLaughter.test`. It consists of 54 videos of parents demonstarting simple jokes to their babies. 
Each video shows one joke from a set of five possibilities [Peekaboo,TearingPaper,NomNomNom,ThatsNotAHat,ThatsNotACat]. For each joke parents rated how funny the child found it and whether they laughed. A larger dataset with 1425 videos is available on request.
